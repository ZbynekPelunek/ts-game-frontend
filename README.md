## Overview

A game inspired by Shakes & Fidget. You have a hero, that you send to adventures to get better items to do harder adventures...
This project also contains a lot of commented code for now because at first, I tried to make the game without using database to see if it is even possible using only REST API. It did work as I imaginated so now I am in middle of adding MongoDB database.
